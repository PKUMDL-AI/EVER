# EVER-Extended Data Figures

1. EVER-Extended figures.pptx contains all figures in the manuscript. 
   
   P.S. Figure 1 is a data-free flow chart, drawn with Microsoft Visio.

2. In the file "EVER-Extended data.xlsx",

   Data in the "gen_incidence" tab are used for drawing Figure 2

   Data in the "incidence_clinic&prediction" tab are used for drawing Figure 3

   Data in the "KD_normalization" tab  are used for drawing Figure 4

   Data in the "IC50_normalization" tab are used for drawing Figure 5

   Data in the "KM&Kcat" and "IC50_normalization" tabs  are used for drawing Figure 6

   Data in the "bosutinib&ponatinib" tab  are used for drawing Figure 7

   Data in the “Gefitinib” tab are used for drawing Figure 8.
