# Abstract

Drug resistance is of increasing concern, especially during the treatments of infectious diseases and cancer. To accelerate the drug discovery process in combating issues of drug resistance, here we developed a computational and experimental strategy to predict drug resistance mutations. Using BCR-ABL as a case study, we successfully recaptured the clinically observed mutations that confer resistance imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib. We then experimentally tested the predicted mutants in vitro. We found that although all mutants showed weakened binding strength as expected, the binding constants alone were not a good indicator of drug resistance. Instead, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was shown to be a good indicator of the incidence of the predicted mutations, together with change in catalytic efficacy. Our suggested strategy for predicting drug-resistance mutations includes the computational prediction and in vitro selection of mutants with increased IC50 values beyond the drug safety window.
